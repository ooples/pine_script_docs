    :depth: 2

This page contains release notes of notable changes in Pine Script.

June 2021
--------------------------
New variable was added:

* ``barstate.islastconfirmedhistory`` - returns ``true`` if script is executing on the dataset's last bar when market is closed, or script is executing on the bar immediately preceding the real-time bar, if market is open. Returns ``false`` otherwise.

New function was added:

* ``round_to_mintick(x)`` - returns the value rounded to the symbol's mintick, i.e. the nearest value that can be divided by ``syminfo.mintick``, without the remainder, with ties rounding up.

Expanded ``tostring()`` functionality. The function now accepts three new formatting arguments:

* ``format.mintick`` to format to tick precision.
* ``format.volume`` to abbreviate large values.
* ``format.percent`` to format percentages.


May 2021
--------------------------
Improved backtesting functionality by adding the Leverage mechanism.

Added support for table drawings and functions for working with them. Tables are unique objects that are not anchored to specific bars; they float in a script’s space, independently of the chart bars being viewed or the zoom factor used. For more information, see our `User Manual page on tables <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/essential/Tables.html>`__.

New functions were added:

* ``color.rgb(red, green, blue, transp)`` - creates a new color with transparency using the RGB color model.
* ``color.from_gradient(value, bottom_value, top_value, bottom_color, top_color)`` - returns color calculated from the linear gradient between bottom_color to top_color.
* ``color.r(color)``, ``color.g(color)``, ``color.b(color)``, ``color.t(color)`` - retrieves the value of one of the color components.
* ``array.from`` - takes a variable number of arguments with one of the types: ``int``, ``float``, ``bool``, ``string``, ``label``, ``line``, ``color``, ``box``, ``table`` and returns an array of the corresponding type. 

A new ``box`` drawing has been added to Pine, making it possible to draw rectangles on charts using the Pine syntax. For more details see the `Pine Script reference <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v4/#fun_box{dot}new>`_ and the `User Manual page on drawings <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/essential/Drawings.html>`_ .

The ``color.new`` function can now accept series and input arguments, in which case, the colors will be calculated at runtime. For more information about this, see our `User Manual page on colors <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v4/essential/Colors.html>`__.



April 2021
--------------------------
New math constants were added: 

* ``math.pi`` - is a named constant for Archimedes' constant. It is equal to 3.1415926535897932.
* ``math.phi`` - is a named constant for the golden ratio. It is equal to  1.6180339887498948.
* ``math.rphi`` - is a named constant for the golden ratio conjugate. It is equal to 0.6180339887498948.
* ``math.e`` - is a named constant for Euler's number. It is equal to 2.7182818284590452.

New math functions were added: 

* ``round(x, precision)`` - returns the value of ``x`` rounded to the nearest integer, with ties rounding up. If the precision parameter is used, returns a float value rounded to that number of decimal places.
* ``median(source, length)`` - returns the median of the series.
* ``mode(source, length)`` - returns the mode of the series. If there are several values with the same frequency, it returns the smallest value.
* ``range(source, length)`` - returns the difference between the ``min`` and ``max`` values in a series.
* ``todegrees(radians)`` - returns an approximately equivalent angle in degrees from an angle measured in radians.
* ``toradians(degrees)`` - returns an approximately equivalent angle in radians from an angle measured in degrees.
* ``random(min, max, seed)`` - returns a pseudo-random value. The function will generate a different sequence of values for each script execution. Using the same value for the optional seed argument will produce a repeatable sequence.

New functions were added:

* ``session.ismarket`` - returns ``true`` if the current bar is a part of the regular trading hours (i.e. market hours), ``false`` otherwise.
* ``session.ispremarket`` - returns ``true`` if the current bar is a part of the pre-market, ``false`` otherwise.
* ``session.ispostmarket`` - returns ``true`` if the current bar is a part of the post-market, ``false`` otherwise.
* ``str.format``  - converts the values to strings based on the specified formats. Accepts certain ``number`` modifiers: ``integer``, ``currency``, ``percent``.



March 2021
--------------------------
New assignment operators were added:

* ``+=``  - addition assignment

* ``group`` - creates a header above all inputs that use the same group string value. The string is also used as the header text.
* ``tooltip`` - adds a tooltip icon to the ``Inputs`` menu. The tooltip string is shown when hovering over the tooltip icon.

New argument for ``fill`` function was added:

* ``fillgaps`` - controls whether fills continue on gaps when one of the ``plot`` calls returns an ``na`` value. 

A new keyword was added:

* ``varip`` - is similar to the ``var`` keyword, but variables declared with ``varip`` retain their values between the updates of a real-time bar.

New functions were added:

* ``tonumber`` - converts a string value into a float.
* ``time_close`` - returns the UNIX timestamp of the close of the current bar, based on the resolution and session that is passed to the function.
* ``dividends`` - requests dividends data for the specified symbol.
* ``earnings`` - requests earnings data for the specified symbol.
* ``splits`` - requests splits data for the specified symbol.

New arguments for the study() function were added:

* ``resolution_gaps`` - fills the gaps between values fetched from higher timeframes when using ``resolution``.
* ``format.percent`` - formats the script output values as a percentage.

  For example, if you don't specify exit parameters for ``strategy.exit`` - ``profit``, ``limit``, ``loss``, ``stop`` or one of the following pairs: ``trail_offset`` and ``trail_price`` / ``trail_points`` - you will see a warning message in the console in the Pine editor.
* Increased the maximum number of arguments in ``max``, ``min``, ``avg`` functions. Now you can use up to ten arguments in these functions.  

October 2019
--------------------------
* ``plotchar`` function now supports most of the Unicode symbols::

    //@version=4
    study("My Script", overlay=true)
    plotchar(open > close, char="🐻")


  .. image:: images/Bears_in_plotchar.png

* New ``bordercolor`` argument of the ``plotcandle`` function allows you to change the color of candles' borders::

    //@version=4
    study("My Script")
    plotcandle(open, high, low, close, title='Title', color = open < close ? color.green : color.red, wickcolor=color.black, bordercolor=color.orange)

--------------------------


New parameters to the ``strategy`` function were added:

* ``process_orders_on_close`` allows the broker emulator to try to execute orders after calculating the strategy at the bar's close

* ``close_entries_rule`` allows to define the sequence used for closing positions

Some fixes were made:

* ``fill`` function now works correctly with ``na`` as the ``color`` parameter value

* ``sign`` function now calculates correctly for literals and constants

``str.replace_all (source, target, replacement)`` function was added. It replaces each occurrence of a ``target`` string in the ``source`` string with a ``replacement`` string

July-August 2019
--------------------------


New variables added: 


* ``timeframe.isseconds`` returns true when current resolution is in seconds
    
* ``timeframe.isminutes`` returns true when current resolution is in minutes
    
* ``time_close`` returns the current bar's close time 

The behavior of some functions, variables and operators has changed:

* The ``time`` variable returns the correct open time of the bar for more special cases than before

* An optional *seconds* parameter of the ``timestamp`` function allows you to set the time to within seconds 

* ``security`` function:
  
  * Added the possibility of requesting resolutions in seconds:

    1, 5, 15, 30 seconds (chart resolution should be less than or equal to the requested resolution)
    
  * Reduced the maximum value that can be requested in some of the other resolutions:
    
    from 1 to 1440 minutes
    
    from 1 to 365 days  
    
    from 1 to 52 weeks
    
    from 1 to 12 months



* Changes to the evaluation of ternary operator branches:

  In Pine v3, during the execution of a ternary operator, both its branches are calculated, so when this script is added to the chart, a long position is opened, even if the long() function is not called::

    //@version=3
    strategy(title = "My Strategy")
    long() =>
        strategy.entry("long", true, 1, when = open > high[1])
        1
    c = 0
    c := true ? 1 : long()
    plot(c)
    
  Pine v4 contains built-in functions with side effects ( ``line.new`` and ``label.new`` ). If calls to these functions are present in both branches of a ternary operator, both function calls would be executed following v3 conventions. Thus, in Pine v4, only the branch corresponding to the evaluated condition is calculated. While this provides a viable solution in some cases, it will modify the behavior of scripts which depended on the fact that both branches of a ternary were evaluated. The solution is to pre-evaluate expressions prior to the ternary operator. The conversion utility takes this requirement into account when converting scripts from v3 to v4, so that script behavior will be identical in v3 and v4.

March 2017
--------------------------
* Pine Script v3 is here! Some important changes:
  
  * Changes to the default behavior of the ``security()`` function: it can no longer access the future data by default. This can be changes with the ``lookahead`` parameter.
  * An implicit conversion of boolean values to numeric values was replaced with an implicit conversion of numeric values (integer and float) to boolean values.
  * Self-referenced and forward-referenced variables were removed. Any PineScript code that used those language constructions can be equivalently rewritten using mutable variables.


February 2017
--------------------------
* Several improvements to the strategy tester and the strategy report:

  * New Buy & Hold equity graph – a new graph that lets you compare performance of your strategy versus a "buy and hold", i.e if you just bought a security and held onto it without trading.
  * Added percentage values to the absolute currency values.
  * Added Buy & Hold Return to display the final value of Buy & Hold Equity based on last price.

September 2015
--------------------------
* Added backtesting functionality to Pine. It is now possible to create trading strategies, i.e. scripts that can send, modify and cancel orders to buy or sell. Strategies allow you to perform backtesting (emulation of strategy trading on historical data) and forward testing (emulation of strategy trading on real-time data) according to your algorithms. Detailed information about the strategy's calculations and the order fills can be seen in the newly added Strategy Tester tab.

July 2015
--------------------------
* A new ``editable`` parameter allows hiding the plot from the Style menu in the indicator settings so that it is not possible to edit its style. The parameter has been added to all the following functions: all plot-type functions, ``barcolor()``, ``bgcolor()``, ``hline()``, and ``fill()``.

June 2015

February 2014
--------------------------

* Added support for inputs, allowing users to edit the indicator inputs through the properties window, without needing to edit the Pine script.
* Added self-referencing variables.
* Added support for multiline functions.
* Implemented the type-casting mechanism, automatically casting constant and simple float and int values to series when it is required.
* Added several new functions and improved the existing ones: 

  * ``barssince()`` and ``valuewhen()`` allow you to check conditions on historical data easier.
  * The new ``barcolor()`` function lets you specify a color for a bar based on filling of a certain condition.
  * Similar to the ``barcolor()`` function, the ``bgcolor()`` function changes the color of the background.
  * Reworked the ``security()`` function, further expanding its functionality.
  * Improved the ``fill()`` function, enabling it to be used more than once in one script.
  * Added the ``round()`` function to round and convert float values to integers.

December 2013

* The first version of Pine is introduced to all TradingView users, initially as an open beta, on December 13th.
