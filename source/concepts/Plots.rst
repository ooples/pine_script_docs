Introduction
------------

The `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ 
function is the most frequently used function used to display information calculated using Pine scripts.
It is versatile and can plot different styles of lines, histograms, areas, columns (like volume columns), fills, circles or crosses.

The use of `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__
to create fills is explained in the page on :ref:`Fills <PageFills>`.

This script showcases a few different uses of `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__
in an overlay script:

.. image:: images/Plots-Introduction-01.png

::

    //@version=5
    indicator("`plot()`", "", true)
    plot(high, "Blue `high` line")
    plot(math.avg(close, open), "Crosses in body center", close > open ? color.lime : color.purple, 6, plot.style_cross)
    plot(math.min(open, close), "Navy step line on body low point", color.navy, 3, plot.style_stepline)
    plot(low, "Gray dot on `low`", color.gray, 3, plot.style_circles)
    
    color VIOLET = #AA00FF
    color GOLD   = #CCCC00
    ma = ta.alma(hl2, 40, 0.85, 6)
    var almaColor = color.silver
    almaColor := ma > ma[2] ? GOLD : ma < ma[2]  ? VIOLET : almaColor
    plot(ma, "Two-color ALMA", almaColor, 2)

Note that:

- The first `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ call plots a 1-pixel blue line across the bar highs.
- The secong plots crosses at the mid-point of bodies. The crosses are colored lime when the bar is up and purple when it is down.
  The argument used for ``linewidth`` is ``6`` but it is not a pixel value; just a relative size.
- The third call plots a 3-pixel wide step line following the low point of bodies.
- The fourth call plot a gray circle at the bars' `low <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_low>`__.
- The last plot requires some preparation. We first define our bull/bear colors,
  calculate an `Arnaud Legoux Moving Average <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000594683>`__,
  then make our color calculations. We initialize our color variable on bar zero only, using `var <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#op_var>`__.
  We initialize it to `color.silver <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_color{dot}silver>`__, 
  so on the dataset's first bars, until one of our conditions causes the color to change, the line will be silver.
  The conditions that change the color of the line require it to be higher/lower than its value two bars ago.
  This makes for less noisy color transitions than if we merely looked for a higher/lower value than the previous one.

This script shows other uses of `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ in a pane:

.. image:: images/Plots-Introduction-02.png

::

    //@version=5
    indicator("Volume change", format = format.volume)
    
    color GREEN         = #008000
    color GREEN_LIGHT   = color.new(GREEN, 50)
    color GREEN_LIGHTER = color.new(GREEN, 85)
    color PINK          = #FF0080
    color PINK_LIGHT    = color.new(PINK, 50)
    color PINK_LIGHTER  = color.new(PINK, 90)
    
    bool  barUp = ta.rising(close, 1)
    bool  barDn = ta.falling(close, 1)
    float volumeChange = ta.change(volume)
    
    volumeColor = barUp ? GREEN_LIGHTER : barDn ? PINK_LIGHTER : color.gray
    plot(volume, "Volume columns", volumeColor, style = plot.style_columns)
    
    volumeChangeColor = barUp ? volumeChange > 0 ? GREEN : GREEN_LIGHT : volumeChange > 0 ? PINK : PINK_LIGHT
    plot(volumeChange, "Volume change columns", volumeChangeColor, 12, plot.style_histogram)
    
    plot(0, "Zero line", color.gray)

Note that:

- We are plotting normal `volume <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_volume>`__ 
  values as wide columns above the zero line 
  (see the ``style = plot.style_columns`` in our `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ call).
- Before plotting the columns we calculate our ``volumeColor`` by using the values of the ``barUp`` and ``barDn`` boolean variables.
  They become respectively ``true`` when the current bar's `close <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_close>`__ 
  is higher/lower than the previous one. Note that the "Volume" built-in does not use the same condition; it identifies an up bar with ``close > open``.
  We use the ``GREEN_LIGHTER`` and ``PINK_LIGHTER`` colors for the volume columns.
- Because the first plot plots columns, we do not use the ``linewidth`` parameter, as it has no effect on columns.
- Our script's second plot is the **change** in volume, which we have calculated earlier using ``ta.change(volume)``.
  This value is plotted as a histogram, for which the ``linewidth`` parameter controls the width of the column.
  We make this width ``12`` so that histogram elements are thinner than the columns of the first plot.
  Positive/negative ``volumeChange`` values plot above/below the zero line; no manipulation is required to achieve this effect.
- Before plotting the histogram of ``volumeChange`` values, we calculate its color value, which can be one of four different colors.
  We use the bright ``GREEN`` or ``PINK`` colors when the bar is up/down AND the volume has increased since the last bar (``volumeChange > 0``).
  Because ``volumeChange`` is positive in this case, the histogram's element will be plotted above the zero line.
  We use the bright ``GREEN_LIGHT`` or ``PINK_LIGHT`` colors when the bar is up/down AND the volume has NOT increased since the last bar.
  Because ``volumeChange`` is negative in this case, the histogram's element will be plotted below the zero line.
- Finally, we plot a zero line. We could just as well have used ``hline(0)`` there.
- We use ``format = format.volume`` in our `indicator() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_indicator>`__ call
  so that large values displayed for this script are abbreviated like those of the built-in "Volume" indicator.

`plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ 
calls must always be placed in a line's first position, which entails they are always in the script's global scope.
They cannot be placed in user-defined functions or structures like `if <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#op_if>`__,
`for <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#op_for>`__, etc. 
Calls to `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ **can**, however, 
be designed to plot conditionally in two ways, which we cover in the :ref:`Conditional plots <PagePlots_ConditionalPlots>`
section of this page.

A script can only plot in its own visual space, whether it is in a pane or on the chart as an overlay.
Scripts running in a pane can only :ref:`color bars <PageBarColoring>` in the chart area.



\`plot()\` parameters
---------------------

The `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ function has the following signature:

.. code-block:: text

    plot(series, title, color, linewidth, style, trackprice, histbase, offset, join, editable, show_last, display) → plot

The parameters of `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ are:

``series``
   It is the only mandatory parameter. Its argument must be of "series int/float" type.
   Note that because the auto-casting rules in Pine convert in the int 🠆 float 🠆 bool direction,
   a "bool" type variable cannot be used as is; it must be converted to an "int" or a "float" for use as an argument.
   For example, if ``newDay`` is of "bool" type, 
   then ``newDay ? 1 : 0`` can be used to plot 1 when the variable is ``true``, and zero when it is ``false``.

``title``
   Requires a "const string" argument, so it must be known at compile time.
   The string appears:

   - In the script's scale when the "Chart settings/Scales/Indicator Name Label" field is checked.
   - In the Data Window.
   - In the "Settings/Style" tab.
   - In the dropdown of `input.source() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_input{dot}source>`__ fields.
   - In the "Condition" field of the "Create Alert" dialog box, when the script is selected.
   - As the column header when exporting chart data to a CSV file.

``color``
   Accepts "series color", so can be calculated on the fly, bar by bar.
   Plotting with `na <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_na>`__
   as the color, or any color with a transparency of 100, is one way to hide plots when they are not needed.

``linewidth``
   Is the plotted element's size, but it does not apply to all styles. When a line is plotted, the unit is pixels.
   It has no impact when `plot.style_columns <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_columns>`__ is used.

``style``
   The available arguments are:

   - `plot.style_line <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_line>`__ (the default):
     It plots a continous line using the ``linewidth`` argument in pixels for its width.
     `na <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_na>`__ values will not plot as a line,
     but they will be briged when a value that is not `na <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_na>`__ comes in.

   - `plot.style_linebr <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_linebr>`__:
     Allows the plotting of discontinuous lines. 
   - `plot.style_stepline <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_stepline>`__:
   - `plot.style_area <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_area>`__:
   - `plot.style_columns <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_columns>`__:
   - `plot.style_histogram <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_histogram>`__:
   - `plot.style_circles <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_circles>`__ or
     `plot.style_cross <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_cross>`__:
     These plot a shape that is not joined across bars unless ``join = true`` is also used.
     For these arguments, the ``linewidth`` argument becomes a relative sizing measure — its units are not pixels.

``trackprice``
   The default value of this is ``false``. When it is ``true``, a dotted line made up of small squares will be plotted
   the full width of the script's visual space. It is often used in conjuction with ``show_last = 1, offset = -99999``
   to hide the actual plot and only leave the residual dotted line.

``histbase``
   It is the reference point used with `plot.style_area <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_area>`__,
   `plot.style_columns <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_columns>`__ and
   `plot.style_histogram <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_histogram>`__.
   It determines the level separating positive and negative values of the ``series`` argument.
   It cannot be calculated dynamically, as an "input int/float" is required.

``offset``
   This allows shifting the plot in the past/future using a negative/positive offset in bars.
   The value cannot change during the script's execution.

``join``
   This only affect styles `plot.style_circles <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_circles>`__ or
   `plot.style_cross <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_plot{dot}style_cross>`__.
   When ``true``, the shapes are joined by a one-pixel line.

``editable``
   This boolean parameter controls whether or not the plot's properties can be edited in the "Settings/Style" tab.
   Its default value is ``true``.

``show_last``
   Allows control over how many of the last bars the plotted values are visible.
   An "input int" argument is required, so it cannot be calculated dynamically.

``display``
  The default is `display.all <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_display{dot}all>`__.
  When it is set to `display.none <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_display{dot}none>`__,
  plotted values will not affect the scale of the script's visual space.
  The plot will be invisible and will not appear in indicator values or the Data Window.
  It can be useful in plots destined for use as external inputs for other scripts,
  or for plots used with the ``{{plot("[plot_title]")}}`` placeholder in 
  `alertcondition() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_alertcondition>`__ calls, e.g.::

    //@version=5
    indicator("")
    r = ta.rsi(close, 14)
    xUp = ta.crossover(r, 50)
    plot(r, "RSI", display = display.none)
    alertcondition(xUp, "xUp alert", message = 'RSI is bullish at: {{plot("RSI")}}')



.. _PagePlots_PlottingConditionally:

Plotting conditionally
----------------------

`plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ calls 
cannot be used in conditional structures such as `if <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#op_if>`__,
but they can be controlled by varying their plotted values, or their color. When no plot is required, 
you can either plot `na <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_na>`__ values,
or plot values using `na <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_na>`__ color
or any color with 100 transparency (which also makes it invisible).



Value control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One way to control the display of plots is to plot `na <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_na>`__ values
when no plot is needed. Sometimes, values returned by functions such as 
`request.security() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_request{dot}security>`__
will return `na <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_na>`__ values, when ``gaps = barmerge.gaps_on`` is used, for example.
In both these cases it is sometimes useful to plot discontinuous lines.
This script shows a few ways to do it:

.. image:: images/Plots-PlottingConditionally-01.png

::

    //@version=5
    indicator("Discontinuous plots", "", true)
    bool plotValues = bar_index % 3 == 0
    plot(plotValues ? high : na, color = color.fuchsia, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_linebr)
    plot(plotValues ? high : na)
    plot(plotValues ? math.max(open, close) : na, color = color.navy, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_cross)
    plot(plotValues ? math.min(open, close) : na, color = color.navy, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_circles)
    plot(plotValues ? low : na, color = plotValues ? color.green : na, linewidth = 6, style = plot.style_stepline)

Note that:

- We define the condition determining when we plot using ``bar_index % 3 == 0``, 
  which becomes ``true`` when the remainder of the division of the bar index by 3 is zero. This will happen every three bars.
- In the first plot, we use ``plot.style_linebr``, which plots the fuchsia line on highs. It is centered on the bar's horizontal midpoint.
- The second plot shows the result of plotting the same values, but without using special care to break the line.
  What's happening here is that the thin blue line of the plain `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ call
  is automatically bridged over `na <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_na>`__ values (or *gaps*), so the plot does not interrupt.
- We then plot navy blue crosses and circles on the body tops and bottoms.
  The ``plot.style_circles`` and ``plot.style_cross`` style are a simple way to plot discontinuous values, e.g., for stop or take profit levels, or support & resistance levels.
- The last plot in green on the bar lows is done using ``plot.style_stepline``. Note how its segments are wider than the fuchsia line segments plotted with ``plot.style_linebr``.
  Also note how on the last bar, it only plots halfway until the next bar comes in.
- The plotting order of each plot is controlled by their order of appearance in the script.
  See 

This script shows how you can restrict plotting to bars after a user-defined date. 
We use the `input.time() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_input{dot}time>`__ function
to create an input widget allowing script users to select a date and time, using Jan 1st 2021 as its default value::

    //@version=5
    indicator("", "", true)
    startInput = input.time(timestamp("2021-01-01"))
    plot(time > startInput ? close : na)



Color control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`Conditional coloring <PageColors_ConditionalColoring>` section of the page on colors discusses color control for plots.
We'll look here at a few examples.

The value of the ``color`` parameter in `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ can be a constant, 
such as one of the built-in :ref:`constant colors <PageColors_ConstantColors>` or a :ref:`color literal <PageTypeSystem_Color>`.
In Pine, the form-type of such colors is called **"const color"** (see the :ref:`Type system <PageTypeSystem>` page). 
They are known at compile time::

    //@version=5
    indicator("", "", true)
    plot(close, color = color.gray)

The color of a plot can also be determined using information that is only known when the script begins execution on the first historical bar of a chart
(bar zero, i.e., ``bar_index == 0`` or ``barstate.isfirst == true``), as will be the case when the information needed to determine a color depends on the chart the script is running on. 
Here, we calculate a plot color using the `syminfo.type <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_syminfo{dot}type>`__ built-in variable,
which returns the type of the chart's symbol. The form-type of ``plotColor`` in this case will be **"simple color"**::

    //@version=5
    indicator("", "", true)
    plotColor = switch syminfo.type
        "stock"     => color.purple
        "futures"   => color.red
        "index"     => color.gray
        "forex"     => color.fuchsia
        "crypto"    => color.lime
        "fund"      => color.orange
        "dr"        => color.aqua
        "cfd"       => color.blue
    plot(close, color = plotColor)
    printTable(txt) => var table t = table.new(position.middle_right, 1, 1), table.cell(t, 0, 0, txt, bgcolor = color.yellow)
    printTable(syminfo.type)

Plot colors can also be chosen through a script's inputs. In this case, the ``lineColorInput`` variable is of form-type **"input color"**::

    //@version=5
    indicator("", "", true)
    color lineColorInput  = input(#1848CC, "Line color")
    plot(close, color = lineColorInput)

Finally, plot colors can also be a *dynamic* value, i.e., a calculated value that is only known on each bar.
These are of form-type **"series color"**::

    //@version=5
    indicator("", "", true)
    plotColor = close >= open ? color.lime : color.red
    plot(close, color = plotColor)

When plotting pivot levels, one common requirement is to avoid plotting level transitions. 
Using :ref:`lines <PageLinesAndBoxes>` is one alternative,
but you can also use `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ like this:

.. image:: images/Plots-PlottingConditionally-02.png

::

    //@version=5
    indicator("Pivot plots", "", true)
    pivotHigh = fixnan(ta.pivothigh(3,3))
    plot(pivotHigh, "High pivot", ta.change(pivotHigh) ? na : color.olive, 3)
    plotchar(ta.change(pivotHigh), "ta.change(pivotHigh)", "•", location.top, size = size.small)

Note that:

- We use ``pivotHigh = fixnan(ta.pivothigh(3,3))`` to hold our pivot values.
  Because `ta.pivothigh() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta{dot}pivothigh>`__
  only returns a value when a new pivot is found, we use `fixnan() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_fixnan>`__
  to fill the gaps with the last pivot value returned. The gaps here refer to the `na <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_na>`__ values
  `ta.pivothigh() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta{dot}pivothigh>`__ returns when no new pivot is found.
- Our pivots are detected three bars after they occur because we use the argument ``3`` for both the ``leftbars`` and ``rightbars`` parameters in our
  `ta.pivothigh() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_ta{dot}pivothigh>`__ call.
- The last plot is plotting a continuous value, but it is setting the plot's color to `na <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_na>`__
  when the pivot's value changes, so the plot isn't visible then. Because of this, a visible plot will only appear after two values are plotted.
- The blue dot indicates when a new high pivot is detected and no plot is drawn between the preceding bar and that one.
  Note how the the pivot on the bar indicated by the arrow has just been detected in the realtime bar,
  yet no plot appears yet. It will only appear on the next bar, making the plot visible **four bars** after the actual pivot.



.. _PagePlots_Levels:

Levels
------

Pine has an `hline() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_hline>`__ 
function to plot horizontal lines (see the page on :ref:`Levels <PageLevels>`).
`hline() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_hline>`__ 
is useful because it has some line styles unavailable with `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__,
but it also has some limitations.

You can plot levels with `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__
in a few different ways. This shows a `CCI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502001>`__
indicator with levels plotted using `plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__:

.. image:: images/Plots-Levels-01.png

::

    //@version=5
    indicator("CCI levels with `plot()`")
    plot(ta.cci(close, 20))
    plot(0,  "Zero", color.gray, 1, plot.style_circles)
    plot(bar_index % 2 == 0 ?  100 : na,  "100", color.lime, 1, plot.style_linebr)
    plot(bar_index % 2 == 0 ? -100 : na, "-100", color.fuchsia, 1, plot.style_linebr)
    plot( 200,  "200", color.green, 2, trackprice = true, show_last = 1, offset = -99999)
    plot(-200, "-200", color.red,   2, trackprice = true, show_last = 1, offset = -99999)
    plot( 300,  "300", color.new(color.green, 50), 1)
    plot(-300, "-300", color.new(color.red, 50),   1)

Note that:

- The zero level is plotted using ``plot.style_circles``.
- The 100 levels are plotted using a conditional value that only plots every second bar.
  In order to prevent the `na <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_na>`__ values
  from being bridged, we use the ``plot.style_linebr`` line style.
- The 200 levels are plotted using ``trackprice = true`` to plot a distinct pattern of small squares that
  extends the full width of the script's visual space. 
  The ``show_last = 1`` in there displays only the last plotted value, which would appear as a one-bar straight line if the next trick wasn't also used:
  the ``offset = -99999`` pushes that one-bar segment far away in the past so that it is never visible.
- The 300 levels are plotted using a continuous line, but a lighter transparency is used to make them less prominent.



Offsets
-------

The ``offset`` parameter specifies the shift used when the line is plotted
(negative values shift in the past, positive values shift into the future.
For example::

    //@version=5
    indicator("", "", true)
    plot(close, color = color.red, offset = -5)
    plot(close, color = color.lime, offset = 5)

.. image:: images/Plots-Offsets-01.png

As can be seen in the screenshot, the *red* series has been shifted to the
left (since the argument's value is negative), while the *green*
series has been shifted to the right (its value is positive).

..
   Note that the ``offset`` parameter requires a "simple int" argument,
   which means it cannot change during the script's execution.



Plot count limit
----------------

Each script is limited to a maximum plot count of 64.
All ``plot*()`` calls and `alertcondition() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#func_alertcondition>`__ calls
count in the plot count of a script. Some types of calls count for more than one in the total plot count.

`plot() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_plot>`__ 
calls count for one in the total plot count if they use a "const color" argument for the ``color`` parameter, 
which means it is known at compile time, e.g.::

    plot(close, color = color.green)

When they use another form, such as any one of these, they will count for two in the total plot count::

    plot(close, color = syminfo.mintick > 0.0001 ? color.green : color.red) //🠆 "simple color"
    plot(close, color = input.color(color.purple)) //🠆 "input color"
    plot(close, color = close > open ? color.green : color.red) //🠆 "series color"
    plot(close, color = color.new(color.silver, close > open ? 40 : 0)) //🠆 "series color"



Scale
-----

Not all values can be plotted everywhere. 
Your script's visual space is always bound by upper and lower limits that are dynamically adjusted with the values plotted.
An `RSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502338>`__ indicator will plot values between 0 and 100, 
which is why it is usually displayed in a distinct *pane* — or area — above or below the chart.
If `RSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502338>`__ values were plotted as an overlay on the chart, 
the effect would be to distort the symbol's normal price scale, 
unless it just hapenned to be close to `RSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502338>`__'s 0 to 100 range.
This shows an `RSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502338>`__ signal line and a centerline at the 50 level, 
with the script running in a separate pane::

    //@version=5
    indicator("RSI")
    myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
    bullColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 50, 80, color.new(color.lime, 70), color.new(color.lime, 0))
    bearColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 20, 50, color.new(color.red,   0), color.new(color.red, 70))
    myRSIColor = myRSI > 50 ? bullColor : bearColor
    plot(myRSI, "RSI", myRSIColor, 3)
    hline(50)

Note that the *y* axis of our script's visual space is automatically sized using the range of values plotted, i.e., 
the values of `RSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502338>`__. 
See the page on :ref:`Colors <PageColors>` for more information on the 
`color.from_gradient() <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_color{dot}from_gradient>`__ function used in the script.

If we try to plot the symbol's 
`close <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_close>`__ 
values in the same space by adding the following line to our script::

    plot(close)

This is what happens:

.. image:: images/Plots-Scale-02.png

The chart is on the BTCUSD symbol, whose `close <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#var_close>`__
prices are around 40000 during this period. Plotting values in the 40000 range makes our `RSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502338>`__ plots in the 0 to 100 range indiscernible.
The same distorted plots would occur if we placed the `RSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502338>`__ indicator on the chart as an overlay.



Merging two indicators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are planning to merge two signals in one script, first consider the scale of each.
It is impossible, for example, to correctly plot an 
`RSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502338>`__ and 
a `MACD <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502344>`__ 
in the same script's visual space because `RSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502338>`__
has a fixed range (0 to 100) while `MACD <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502344>`__ doesn't, as it plots moving averages calculated on price.

If both your indicators used fixed ranges, you can shift the values of one of them so they do not overlap.
We could, for example, plot both `RSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502338>`__ (0 to 100)
and the `True Strength Indicator (TSI) <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000592290>`__ (-100 to +100) by displacing one of them.
Our strategy here will be to compress and shift the `TSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000592290>`__ values
so they plot over `RSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502338>`__::

    //@version=5
    indicator("RSI and TSI")
    myRSI = ta.rsi(close, 20)
    bullColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 50, 80, color.new(color.lime, 70), color.new(color.lime, 0))
    bearColor = color.from_gradient(myRSI, 20, 50, color.new(color.red,   0), color.new(color.red, 70))
    myRSIColor = myRSI > 50 ? bullColor : bearColor
    plot(myRSI, "RSI", myRSIColor, 3)
    hline(100)
    hline(50)
    hline(0)
    
    // 1. Compress TSI's range from -100/100 to -50/50.
    // 2. Shift it higher by 150, so its -50 min value becomes 100.
    myTSI = 150 + (100 * ta.tsi(close, 13, 25) / 2)
    plot(myTSI, "TSI", color.blue, 2)
    plot(ta.ema(myTSI, 13), "TSI EMA", #FF006E)
    hline(200)
    hline(150)

Note that:

- We have added levels using `hline <https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/#fun_hline>`__
  to situate both signals.
- In order for both signal lines to oscillate on the same range of 100,
  we divide the `TSI <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000592290>`__ value by 2 because it has a 200 range (-100 to +100).
  We then shift this value up by 150 so it oscillates between 100 and 200, making 150 its centerline.
- The manipulations we make here are typical of the compromises required to bring two indicators
  with different scales in the same visual space, even when their values, contrary to 
  `MACD <https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000502344>`__, are bounded in a fixed range.
